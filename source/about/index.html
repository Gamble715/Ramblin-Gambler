I started my life in the land of Ice and Snow, Buffalo, New York. No doubt where I get my beard skillz. My family raised me in spite of my dreamy imagination and stubborn refusal to clean my room. When I took for the road to the land of the palmetto I kept a piece of myself back in Buffalo to help me never forget where I came from.

In the Land of the Palmetto I was taught how to read dry books and listen to bored people lecture. I learned how to sift what was good and what was worthless. The truth I followed as well as the people who followed with me have brought me here, sitting in front of technology, telling my story that is still unfolding.
